In all the interviews I have given in my career for the frontend role, 
80% of them have asked questions that were strictly based on JavaScript and its concepts and 20% on the DSA.


The JavaScript questions cover the topics of:
•Promises
•Closure
•Currying
•Piping
•Method-chaining
•Polyfills
•this
•Design-patterns, etc


The DSA questions are primarily around:

•Arrays
•Objects
•linked-List
•Trees
•Hashmap
•Hashset
•Search
•Sort

Things to look out for:

•Right usage of data structures
•Evaluating the edge cases
•Think first, discuss, clarify, and then write the code
•Explain the time and space complexity of DSA
