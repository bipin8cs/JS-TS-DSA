System design is a very subjective process; there is no right system; 
it is all about adjusting or fine-tuning according to the requirements, 
so it is essential to note down and have a clear understanding of what you have to design.

Once the requirements are clear, you can discuss the points. But for discussion, you should be aware of multiple concepts around the frontend/web ecosystem.

Usually, you will be asked to design a feature set for the most common and popular frontend applications.

•Rendering strategy is the most important thing, and 
based on the nature of the application, decide the rendering first and then everything on top of that.
The best way to prepare is to read multiple engineering blogs, understand what others have done, and 
then spare 45 minutes and try to design a popular system on your own. Write down the points on:
