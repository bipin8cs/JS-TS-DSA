//Web-fundamentals round (could be asked)


In the web fundamentals round, your knowledge and understanding of the web ecosystem will be evaluated.
All the optimization concepts will be asked about and discussed.
This is similar to the system-design round, but rather than designing a system, 
you will be asked to list down all the best practices that you will follow to address the issues in any web application.
Things to look out for:
•Speak about things you fully understand; you can be counter-questioned.
•Use your personal experience while answering to ensure that you know what you do at work.
