Machine-coding round
The machine-coding round evaluates your hands-on experience building things. 
You will be asked to create a common UI component in Vanilla JS or any framework of your choice.

For example, in Atlassian, I was asked to code an extendable TIC-TAC-TOE 
where the board size can be dynamic and the algorithm to evaluate who won in the framework of my choice.

In PingIdentity, I was asked to code search with the pagination in Vanilla JS.

There is no hard-and-fast rule,
 and the best way to prepare is by building the same component in both Vanilla JS and the framework of your choice.

You can go through the Low-Level Design Questions list and implement all the UI components from the W3Schools how-to section for practice.




Things to look out for:

•Make sure components are reusable and extendable.
•Focus on the core features first, and then on the extended features.
•Write test cases if time permits.
•There can be two interviewers for this round; one will be evaluating in silence, 
 so speak out your approach very loudly.
•Don't assume anything, clarfiy if in doubt.
